# Rollet NOÉ

NOÉ is a booking and patient management system for drive-through virology
testing, born in April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was first
implemented in Hungary across 2 commercially operating locations, complete with
a full fledged drive-through testing facility and operational solution. Check it
out at https://www.tesztallomas.hu

We stand for making testing as accessible and widespread as possible to better
understand and mitigate the epidemic. NOÉ is free to use as a backend for such
an operation by any government or organization, whether it’s free or commercial,
licensed under the MIT licence.

Features:

- Registration flow for patients
- Multi-location support
- Health survey to pre-screen for symptoms
- Operator-assigned time slots for visitors to book
- Mobile app for on-site test administration and other information access
- Django Admin based management and role handling
- Multi-product support (e.g. PCR testing and serological testing)
- Enabled for online payment and online invoicing for commercial applications

Rollet publishes NOÉ at no charge and free to use. If your government body or
organization require technical support or operations, feel free to contact us at

# About Rollet

Rollet is a payment service that enables drive-through payments with any car.
With Rollet’s vehicle identification technology, your car becomes a payment
token, so no cash or card payments are needed at parking lots, fuel stations, or
even drive-through restaurants.
